[![SwiftPM 5.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ“¦_spm-5.3-ED523F.svg?style=flat)](https://swift.org/download/) [![@maximkrouk](https://img.shields.io/badge/contact-@maximkrouk-1DA1F2.svg?style=flat&logo=twitter)](https://twitter.com/maximkrouk)

A mechanism for safe capturing & weakifying objects in Swift.

## Usage Examples

```swift
Without weak
```

```swift
With weak
```

----

Default
```swift
{ [weak self] in 
  guard let self = self else { return }
  /// ...
}
```

```swift
capture { _self in
  /// ...
}
```

----

Multiple parameters
```swift
{ [weak self] a, b, c in 
  guard let self = self else { return }
  /// ...
}
```

```swift
capture { _self, a, b, c in 
  /// ...
}
```

---

Methods

```swift
{ [weak self] in 
  guard let self = self else { return }
  self.someMethod()
}
```

```swift
capture(Self.someMethod)
```

----

Return values

```swift
let object.dataSource = { [weak self] in
  guard let self = self else { return [] }
  return self.data
}
```

```swift
let object.dataSource = capture(or: [], in: \.data)
```

## Installation

### Basic

You can add `weak` to an Xcode project by adding it as a package dependency.

1. From the **File** menu, select **Swift Packages â€º Add Package Dependencyâ€¦**
2. Enter [`"https://github.com/capturecontext/swift-capture"`](https://github.com/capturecontext/swift-capture) into the package repository URL text field
3. Choose products you need to link them to your project.

### Recommended

If you use SwiftPM for your project, you can add `weak` to your package file. Also my advice is to use SSH.

```swift
.package(
  name: "weak",
  url: "git@github.com:capturecontext/swift-capture.git",
  .upToNextMajor("2.0.0")
)
```

Do not forget about target dependencies:

```swift
.product(
    name: "swift-capture",
    name: "Capture", 
    package: "swift-capture"
)
```
